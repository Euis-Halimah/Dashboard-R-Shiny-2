CASE:
In the research article "Navigating the Clickscape: Understanding the Impact of Ad Placement on Click-Through
Rates," published in the International Journal of Digital Marketing, the effect of advertisement placement on a
website's click-through rates (CTR) is analyzed. The study was carried out over a two-week period on a popular news
website, focusing on the CTRs for a new brand of sports footwear, referred to as "ZoomRunners." The ads for
ZoomRunners were placed in three different locations on the website: the left sidebar, the center (within the
content), and the right sidebar. Each ad location was alternated every three hours to prevent time-of-day bias. The
website layout included various other advertisements and content to simulate a real browsing experience. CTRs,
measured as the number of clicks per hundred views, for the ZoomRunners ads at the three different locations are
given below. Determine if there is a significant difference in the average CTR based on ad placement on the website
using a 0.05 level of significance.
Ad Placement | Left Sidebar | Center Page | Right Sidebar
-------------|--------------|-------------|---------------
Day 1 | 2.5 | 3.8 | 3.1
Day 2 | 2.7 | 3.5 | 2.9
Day 3 | 2.8 | 4.0 | 3.0
Day 4 | 2.6 | 3.7 | 3.2
Day 5 | 3.0 | 3.9 | 3.3
Day 6 | 2.4 | 3.6 | 2.8
Day 7 | 2.9 | 4.1 | 3.4
Day 8 | 2.5 | 3.4 | 3.1
Day 9 | 2.6 | 3.8 | 3.2
Day 10 | 2.7 | 3.9 | 3.5
You are a Digital Marketing Analyst who has been given the task of creating an interactive tool to analyze the
effectiveness of product placement strategies. For this project, you will use R and the Shiny package to develop an
application that allows users to input their own data and assess the impact of product ad placements on clickthrough rates (CTR) on a website.
The application should allow usersto enter data for three different ad placement locations: leftsidebar, center page,
and right sidebar. Each ad location should be considered for its CTR performance. Reflect on whether the findings
from this analysis could be applicable to other forms of digital advertisements across various website layouts.
